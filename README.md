Problem - Among all employee related problems, employee attrition is one of the key problem in the today's scenario despite the changes in the external environment. Attrition is said to be gradual reduction in number of employees through resignation, death and retirement.When a well-trained and well-adapted employee leaves the organization for any of the reason, it creates an empty space in an organization (i.e) there occurs a vacuum in the organization. It creates a great difficulty for a Human resource personnel to fill the gap that has occurred.  

#### Create a report which shows the Attrition based on different parameters. Analyse the data in depth using all the columns mentioned. The dashboard should be dynamic and it should clearly state the objective which is to find the reason of Attrition.
